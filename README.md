# Where-do-i-even-start

Ever wanted to move to a new city or country but had no idea where to even begin? Struggle to organise your thoughts? Well tthis app can help!
With the help of AI, you can generate a todo list to help tell you what to do and then you can add, delete and modify to your liking!

This was my final project for my Fullstack course at BIT!

The stlying inspired by a cross between bento boxes, japanese candy making kits and pill containers! During my research I discovered Neumorphism!

# Where-do-i-even-start

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application built with React, Tailwind CSS, Socket.IO, and Express that utilizes the OpenAI GPT API to generate todo lists for travel-related tasks. It assists users in organizing their plans and tasks when relocating or planning a trip.

## Features
- AI-powered Todo List Generation: The application uses the OpenAI GPT API to generate todo lists based on user prompts related to travel or relocation.
- Real-time Streaming: The backend streams JSON-formatted todo list data to the frontend in response to user queries.
- Neumorphism-inspired Styling: The user interface design is inspired by a blend of bento boxes, Japanese candy making kits, and pill containers.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Built with React, the frontend interacts with the AI backend through Socket.IO to display generated todo lists.
- **Backend**: The backend is powered by Express, integrating the OpenAI GPT API to process user prompts and generate task lists. Socket.IO facilitates real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding the OpenAI API key.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.
5. Launch the frontend application using `npm start` in the client directory.

## Usage
- Access the application in your browser.
- Enter prompts related to travel or relocation in the provided input field.
- View the generated JSON-formatted todo list as a response to your queries.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed as the final project for a Fullstack course at BIT.
